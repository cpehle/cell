CELL: Continuous and Event-based Logic Language
===============================================


Compiling & Installation
------------------------

CELL uses waf as build tool. You can select a compiler using the CC and CXX
environment variables.  For example to use clang:

  $ export CC=clang
  $ export CXX=clang++
  $ ./waf configure

Compile using

  $ ./waf build

If you want you can install using

  $ ./waf install

Specifiy a --prefix option to ./waf configure to select where the installation
should go.


Tests
-----

CELL uses the Google Test framework. The main executable is called test-main.
After ./waf build you can execute it

  $ cd build
  $ ./test-main

There is also an experimental mock-up of the planned verification methodology
using C++: tb_driver.  The binary is available in build/ and reports pass/fail
via its return code.

All tests are automatically run after building by waf.


Documentation
-------------

Source code reference documentation generated by Doxygen is available in
doc/doxygen/ and automatically built by waf.
